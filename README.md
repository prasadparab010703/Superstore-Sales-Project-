Imagine you are a diligent sales manager at Superstore Sales - one of Canadaâ€™s largest retail stores.
You have gotten a dataset on the supermarket's sales for various regions in the country. 
You want to know which product subcategories are making the company more profits and which are making it heavy losses.
If you get these insights, you may decide to either discontinue the loss making subcategories of products or come up with some other business strategy based on your derived insights.
